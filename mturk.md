## Launch on MTurk Sandbox

This page will explain how you can launch your task on Amazon MTurk! Let's get started below:

#### 1. Enable Sandbox Mode
**Make sure** that in `app/mturk/settings.py`, `is_sandbox = True` in the `mturk` dictionary:
```python
mturk = {
    # If this is False, real money will be deducted
    'is_sandbox': True,
    # ...
}
```

#### 2. Disable Local Debug Mode
**Make sure** that in `app/settings.py`, `debug = True` in the `server` dictionary:
```python
server = {
    # If this is False, real money will be deducted
    'debug': False,
    # ...
}
```

#### 3. Delete our build!
Currently, for launching on MTurk, you're going to need to delete the following folders:

1. `app/react_app/build/`
2. `app/react_app/node_modules/`

If the folders don't exist, you can skip this step!

We're working hard to remove steps like this (to make your life easier), but for now, please delete the above folders before proceeding to the next step.

> Note: If you want to run your task locally again, make sure to run `npm install` and `npm run build` inside of `react_app` again.


#### 4. Run the MTurk Command
Whilst still in the `app/` folder, lets go ahead and run the following command:
```
python3 launch_hits.py --task_name demo
```

> Note: After running the above command, you might be asked for some AWS and Heroku information. It should be pretty self explanatory how to provide this information. 

And voil√†! After about **5 minutes** (unforuntely there is some setup time required for launching a web server on Heroku), you should get some links below:
