# Viewing your Data

#### Pre-requisites

This page will explain how you can view your data. Before trying to view your data, it is strongly recommended you check out:

1. [Launching Tasks on MTurk](/mturk)
2. [How to Save Data in LegoEVAL](/savingdata)


#### Viewing Your Data

To view any data collected from MTurk (both sandbox & production), first, open up `view_data.py` under the `app/` directory.

You're going to want to change the `task_name` variable to the same `task_name` you used in the [previous section](/mturk).

Finally, you can print each data-point you've collected like so:

```python
# view_data.py

# ...

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Specify your task name
    task_name = "my-task-name"
    
    # Load the data by calling 'load_data'
    data = load_data(task_name)
    
    # Print each data-point
    for data_point in data:
        print(data_point)
```

> Each data point corresponds to a **HIT** (Human Intelligence Task) generated by MTurk.
