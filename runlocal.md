# Running a Task Locally

It's pretty easy to compile and run a task locally in your browser:


#### Run the `local_test.py` Command

**Make sure** you're in the `app/` directory, run the following command and jump to [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:2988/helloworld).
```bash
python3 local_test.py
```


#### Next Steps

If you're happy with your task, why not try running it on [Amazon Mechanical Turk](/mturk)?
